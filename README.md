## Description

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

The Note Taker is an application that allows users to write, save, and delete notes that can be easily stored and retrieved from a remote server. The notes are saved via JSON objects that each have a unique Id attributed to them (via Uniqid's npm package) for back-end retrieval. The server is run using Express.js which allows for efficient storage via Express' middleware technology. 

A live version of the application can be found via ![heroku]()

Example screenshots of the application can also be found below:
